So the reporting cloud access information is as follows,
url: reportingcloud.east.toolwatch.net
Login : INPN2
Password : 65o9COKFPbC38CF7

Cost Center to use is #1223.  - Kavod Senior Life

To date postings amount to: $107,801.96
the postings consist of tools & equipment, materials & consumables, and misc charges (misc charges I believe are in their own view).
They will want to reference the billing side of the rate sheets.

Also I have attached a printout of the to date postings for the cost center.
Let me know if you have any questions.


CUSTOM NOTES

- add posted per cost center to view
- total billed (posted) for life of cost center
- new col: TotalPostToDate
